### Procrastination (Postponing):
We all suffer from procrastination at some time or another, This basically means that we choose to postpone doing a task / action (Right Thing) and instead make the decision to action easier/low priority tasks, that will take less time, or those that we find enjoyable.

#### Reasons:
- We find doing right thing unpleasant
- We find it difficult
- We feel tough decisions are required

#### Tips that may help: 
- When procrastinating/postponing, the best thing you can do is to admit it and  Stop rationalizing and you’ll be more likely to act.
- Analyze what causes you to put things off. Most of us tend to avoid things that are unpleasant, complex, or overwhelming.
- Do the toughest tasks first.
- Tackle unpleasant tasks in small pieces and short time segments.
- Delegate the task to someone who may enjoy doing it. Others often enjoy what we don’t!
- Don’t be a perfectionist and accept that some risk may exist.

### Reflect Your Day
- Go through the events of the day in your mind and write them down 
- Take note of any insights 
- Ask yourself what you have achieved today / this week / this month. 
- Organize your projects' next important tasks. 
- Ask yourself what is going to be the most important thing to do tomorrow. 

### Mistakes are great opportunities to learn from… 
- Believing in someone or something that’s too good to be true

- Trying to be someone you’re not - Happiness and success demand authenticity
- Trying to please everyone
- Playing the victim
- Trying to change someone


#### IC (Individual Contriobutor) to Leadership 
- solve problems by removing roadblocks (including yourself), streamlining processes, and helping others be productive. You don't solve the problem yourself now; you create an environment where other people can solve the problem.
- Leadership is based on two-way communication (between you and your leaders, and then between you and your team)
- You must be in frequent communication with your own manager and leadership in order to understand the bigger vision for the organization, and then you can drill down on what your team needs to accomplish and why. 
- you should be well practiced at letting go of micromanaging and instead trusting the people on your team to do good work (i.e., delegation)
- you have to learn how to balance trusting your team with avoiding a disaster
- Knowing what calls matter comes from understanding what is most important, and how these decisions influence the overall strategy.
- zoom out two to three years into the future and ask yourself the following questions:
    - How do all of your teams fit together?
    -  How should resources be distributed?
    -  Which projects and people are critical to the organization's most important goals?
    -  What lessons do you need your managers to learn?
    -  Where can you allow them to take control and make mistakes?
    -  What areas cannot fail and therefore need your oversight?
