### Procrastination (Postponing):
We all suffer from procrastination at some time or another, This basically means that we choose to postpone doing a task / action (Right Thing) and instead make the decision to action easier/low priority tasks, that will take less time, or those that we find enjoyable.

#### Reasons:
- We find doing right thing unpleasant
- We find it difficult
- We feel tough decisions are required

#### Tips that may help: 
- When procrastinating/postponing, the best thing you can do is to admit it and  Stop rationalizing and you’ll be more likely to act.
- Analyze what causes you to put things off. Most of us tend to avoid things that are unpleasant, complex, or overwhelming.
- Do the toughest tasks first.
- Tackle unpleasant tasks in small pieces and short time segments.
- Delegate the task to someone who may enjoy doing it. Others often enjoy what we don’t!
- Don’t be a perfectionist and accept that some risk may exist.
